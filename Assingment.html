									Your fall spice tickles my senses as I sigh, falling into the joy of our annual ceremony.<br>
									I am not alone in my adoration of you, but I do not grow jealous as others call your name,
									Rather I find a sort of community in our shared appreciation,
									Like a perfect song you were meant for the world, not one,
									Yet each of us singular in the definition of our experience with you.</p></div>

				<div class="qwe"><p>It was always that Peppermint White Mocha.
							It's so funny that a simple drink... one that I choose every single time.
							A drink my friends and I have turned into a small inside joke.
							A drink that tastes like Christmas ( which you know I hated) and Joy ( but i was always too pessimistic right?).<br>

							A drink that no matter the weather I still choose that one single drink.
							Don't get me wrong, I've tested other flavors.
							I've tried it iced.
							I've tried it blended.
							I've tried it at a local coffee shop in every city I go too.
							But nothing compares to the original.</p></div>
